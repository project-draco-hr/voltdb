'\n    Some basic tests using Apache "requests" module\n    (http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html) to handle\n    simple communications with the server.\n\n    Get "requests": $ easy_install requests or download the module\n    and then install.\n\n    In "setUp", make the request and get the response. Then the\n    tests are all specific assertions about the result.\n\n    The requests could be in the tests themselves. There are pluses\n    and minuses in all the different possible approaches.\n\n    Next steps -- we can consider this approach, consider "pytest"\n    instead of "unittest", and review other options.\n\n    I\'ll convert this to pytest and we can see if that\'s better or\n    worse or just different.\n'
